To upload an image: Click on the edit tab; Click the 'Insert Image' button in the toolbar and drag and drop an image on to the icon; Click insert - this will upload the image, you can then grab the image url (everything after '{{site.baseurl}}'), this is what you want to paste here. You can then delete that text from the editor. Sorry thatâ€˜s a little convoluted."
